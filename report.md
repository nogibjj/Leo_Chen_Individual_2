# Performance Comparison Report

## Rust
- Execution time: 70.88ms
- Memory usage: 6389760 KB
- CPU usage: 104.84123%

## Python
- Execution time: 206.97ms
- Memory usage: 8609430 KB
- CPU usage: 172.63828%


This performance comparison indicates that the **Rust implementation outperforms Python** in both execution time and resource usage, completing the task over **three times faster** (70.88ms vs. 206.97ms) while utilizing less CPU (104.84% vs. 172.64%) and memory (6,389,760 KB vs. 8,609,430 KB). These results suggest that Rust's lower-level memory management and optimized execution make it more efficient for CPU- and memory-intensive tasks. This efficiency can be particularly beneficial for applications requiring high performance and scalability.
